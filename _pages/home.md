I am a postdoctoral researcher at **ENS Paris**, in the DATA team of the [Centre for Data Science (CSD)](https://csd.ens.psl.eu/?Presentation-du-CDD), where I work with [Bruno Loureiro](https://brloureiro.github.io/) .

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**, working with [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com/). Prior to that, I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Satya Majumdar](https://www.lptms.universite-paris-saclay.fr/satya-majumdar/) and [Marc Potters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-potters-cfm/) .I hold Master’s degrees in **Mathematics** and **Theoretical Physics** from **ENS Paris** and **Sorbonne Université**, respectively.

My research investigates problems in **machine learning** and **high-dimensional statistics and probability**, especially those where **random matrix theory** plays a central role in characterizing  statistical limits and algorithmic performance.
